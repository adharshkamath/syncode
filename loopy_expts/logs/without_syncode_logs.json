For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\n-----\nExample:\nConsider the following C program:\n```\nint main() {\n  \n  int x;\n  int y;\n  \n  (x = 1);\n  (y = 0);\n\n  while ((y < 100000)) {\n    {\n    (x  = (x + y));\n    (y  = (y + 1));\n    }\n\n  }\n  //@ assert( (x >= y) );\n}\n```\nOne of the possible loop invariants for the while loop is:\nloop invariant 0 <= y <= 100000;\nloop invariant x >= (1 + (y - 1) * y / 2);\n-----\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.

For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\n-----\nExample:\nConsider the following C program:\n```\nint main() {\n  \n  int x;\n  int y;\n  \n  (x = 1);\n  (y = 0);\n\n  while ((y < 100000)) {\n    {\n    (x  = (x + y));\n    (y  = (y + 1));\n    }\n\n  }\n  //@ assert( (x >= y) );\n}\n```\nOne of the possible loop invariants for the while loop is:\nloop invariant 0 <= y <= 100000;\nloop invariant x >= (1 + (y - 1) * y / 2);\n-----\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Do not use the \\at(x, Pre) notation for any variable x.**\n- **Do not use non-deterministic function calls.**\n\nConsider the following C program:\n```\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#define assume(e) if(!(e)) exit(-1);\nextern int unknown_int(void);\n\nint nondet_int();\n\nint main () {\n\nint x;\nint y;\nint xa = 0;\nint ya = 0;\n\nwhile (unknown_int()) {\n\tx = xa + 2*ya;\n\ty = -2*xa + ya;\n\n\tx++;\n\tif (unknown_int()) y\t= y+x;\n\telse y = y-x;\n\n\txa = x - 2*y;\n\tya = 2*x + y;\n}\n\n{;\n//@ assert(xa + 2*ya >= 0);\n}\n\nreturn 0;\n}\n\n```\n\nYou are allowed to use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. Use implication (==>) instead of using if-then.\n\nFor all variables, add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that they can take, if such bounds exist.\n\nIf a variable is always equal to or smaller or larger than another variable, add a conjunction for their relation.\n\nIf the assertion is guarded by a condition, use the guard condition in an implication.\n\nIf certain variables are non-deterministic at the beginning or end of the loop, use an implication to make the invariant trivially true at that location. \n\nOutput the loop invariants for the loop in the program above.
